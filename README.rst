docpath
#######

The *docpath* package aims to provide a way of specifying paths to nodes, or
sets of nodes, in a docutils_ doctree.  Where practical it uses similar syntax
to `xpath 1.0`_, but diverges from this to allow easier parsing and evaluation
of paths using common python tools and language features.
